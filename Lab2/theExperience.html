        <p>This is what it takes to build your own mechanical keyboard! Although it may look way too complex and confusing,
            starting from a very basic kit can help you get started. You can also buy a prebuilt keyboard that you don't have to
            assemble yourself, and later swap out the different parts that you want to change. The fun part about building mechanical
            keyboards is that you can change it be however you want!
