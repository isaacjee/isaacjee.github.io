        <p>Most mechanical keyboards will have software available to remap keys, make macros, etc. Software such as QMK/VIA have been
            developed to do these things, and can be accessed through the internet. Most keyboards are compatible with QMK/VIA, but some 
            use their own built-in software to do these things, although sometimes in a slightly limited capacity.
        </p>
        <p>This means that you can do things like make some cool shortcuts with keys or change the mapping of your keys to fit whatever 
            is most comfortable to you!
