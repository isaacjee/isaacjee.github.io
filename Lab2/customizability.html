        <br>
        <p>Mechanical keyboards are made up of a bunch of different parts, such as the case, switches, keycaps, etc. With so many different
            parts that go into putting a keyboard together, that means it has a lot of potential to be customized. Every part of a keyboard
            can be changed to fit how you want it to look, sound, and feel.
        </p>
        <h2>Here are a few of the basic customizable things:</h2>
        <h3>Layouts</h3>
        <p>The main layouts are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>60%</li>
            <li>65%</li>
            <li>75%</li>
            <li>TKL</li>
            <li>100%/Full-sized</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The different layouts tell you which keys/how many keys are included on the keyboard. For example, 60% keyboard means that it only includes
            60% of a regular keyboard, so it excludes things like the number row, F-row, numpad, and arrow keys. But a 75% does include the number 
            row and F-row and arrow keys, but still excludes a few extra keys and the numpad. Overall, the keyboard layout will determine the
            the functionality and size of the keyboard.
        </p>
        <h3>Switches</h3>
        <p>There are 3 different types of switches:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Type</th>
                <th>Feel</th>
                <th>Sound</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Linear</td>
                <td>Smooth and consistent throughout the keystroke</td>
                <td>Only makes a sound when you push the key all the way down</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Tactile</td>
                <td>A small "bump" when pressing down on the key</td>
                <td>Only makes a sound when you push the key all the way down</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Clicky</td>
                <td>A small "bump" when pressing down on the key</td>
                <td>Makes a click noise when pressing past the "bump"</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>The different parts of a switch (the spring, top housing, bottom housing, and stem) also vary. The spring
            can come in different lengths and weights, which impact the feel of the switch. And the top housing, bottom housing, and 
            stem can be made from different plastics that impact the sound of the switch. Overall, switches will change how typing feels
            and sounds.
        </p>
        <h3>Keycaps</h3>
        <p>The main profiles of keycaps are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cherry</li>
            <li>OEM</li>
            <li>SA</li>
            <li>DSA</li>
            <li>XDA</li>
        </ul>

        class="center" style="width: 30%;" >
        <p>The different profiles of keycaps impact the feel of typing. Keycaps also come in two different plastics: ABS or PBT.
            They differ in feel and also practical things like durability. Overall, keycaps will change typing feels and also they
            heavily impact the aesthetic of the keyboard.
